# Hierarchical AND/OR Graph

This is the repository for Hierarchical AND/OR grapph. Using that, you can a easily represent a custom task to follow.
This module is developed mainly for represeting the robot tasks, but it is not limited to that. The user can easily embed the AND/OR graph in any middleware; in our case we provide an example how to embeds in [ROS](http://www.ros.org/).  
a ros service mdoule for the Task Representation.
