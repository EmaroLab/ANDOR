# Hierarchical AND/OR Graph

This is the repository for Hierarchical AND/OR grapph, which can be employed as a *Task Representation* module.
It semantically formalizes a process between operators (humans and/or robots).
Using that, you can a easily represent a custom task to follow.
This module is developed mainly for represeting the human or robot tasks, but it is not limited to that. The user can easily embed the AND/OR graph in any middleware; in our case we develop it as a [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) package with a service-client paradigm.

# :orange_book: The general idea

An AND/OR graph *G(N,H)* consists of a set of nodes *N* and a set of hyper-arcs *H*. A node *n ∈ N* represents a *state* of the cooperation, whereas a hyper-arc *h ∈ H* represents a specific *state transition* among states. In particular, a hyper-arc *h* connects a set of *child* nodes *N<sub>C</sub> ⊆ N* to a *parent* node *n<sub>P</sub> ∈ N*. 
The relation between child nodes in a hyper-arc is the logic AND, while the relation between different hyper-arcs inducing on the same parent node is the logic OR.
Each hyper-arc *h ∈ H* corresponds to a sequence of ordered actions, *A(h)*, to be executed by the human operator or the robot to reach the cooperation status described by the parent node.


# :hammer: Dependencies and build
The only dependency is [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) and you can download it from [here](http://www.ros.org/install/).

After installing ros, using git, clone the repo in your `src` directory of your ros workspace, or download the repo and extract it in `src` directory of your ros workspace.

```
cd <path to your ros workspace>
catkin_make
```

# :running: Using the software

To write an AND/OR graph description, please follow the instructions provided [here](./docs/Instructions.md).

You can generate [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) documentation using follwoing command:
```
cd <path to your ros workspace>/andor

doxygen doxygen_config
```

# :nerd_face: Mantainers
If you have any question regarding the implementation, you can open an issue in the repo and CC the maintainer or contact directly the maintainer.
